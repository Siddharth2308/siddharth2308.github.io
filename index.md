# Hi, I am Siddharth 
{: .fs-9 }

I like to work on projects that tackle real life challenges by developing sustainable tech based solutions.
I am interested in early stage prototyping and R&D projects that involve mechanical / electrical / software engineering.

> Currently I work in ***Embedded Real Time Systems Lab at IIT Bombay***. I am also associated with ***Vigyan Ashram*** and have worked on several projects with them. At the ERTS Lab I am involed in the E-Yantra Project, Agriculture IOT and Robotics Research. I have listed few of my projects below. Please vist the ***[Projects](docs/Projects.html)*** section to get better idea about my work.

{: .note }
> I am also the Theme Developer / Mentor in the [e-Yantra Robotics Competition](https://portal.e-yantra.org/themeIntro) for the theme of Logistic coBot. This theme focuses on training students about industrial robotics using remote lab setup and Robot Operating System (ROS2).
