### Introduction
I am an Electronics Engineer, and I currently work in the ERTS Lab at IIT Bombay. My work at the lab is focused on research in agricultural automation and development of various weather data acquisition devices. Another domain I work on at ERTS Lab is remote labs for robotics education. I am also associated with Vigyan
Ashram and volunteer to help them in many of their technical projects. I usually work on projects that address
real life challenges and work on developing sustainable tech based solutions.

### Research Interests
Broadly, speaking I am interested in Embedded Systems, Mechatronics, and Robotics and its integration to solved
real world challenges. I enjoy working on early stage prototypes and projects that involve low level implementations
in electronics, mechanical or software engineering. I am open to explore adjacent research areas. The topic that
currently fascinates me is, studying multi-agent approach and control policies in low-level mechatronic systems
which include CNC’s and eventually robotics going ahead.

I am also interested in sensor technology and data acquistion, particularly for micro and meso climate sensing in agricultural and urban context.
